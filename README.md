# Frontend Mentor – Clipboard Landing Page Solution

This is my solution to the **Clipboard Landing Page** challenge on Frontend Mentor. The project focuses on building a clean, modern, and fully responsive landing page based on a provided design, following best practices in semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and scalable styling architecture.

This challenge was a great opportunity to practice mobile-first development, Flexbox and Grid layouts, CSS custom properties, and UI micro-interactions.

## Overview
This project is a responsive product landing page that adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. It features a hero section with call-to-action buttons, multiple content sections explaining product features, brand logos, and a structured footer with navigation and social media links.

The main goal was to closely replicate the original Frontend Mentor design while keeping the codebase clean, semantic, accessible, and easy to maintain.

The project follows a mobile-first approach and progressively enhances the layout for larger screens using modern CSS techniques.

## The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size.
- Experience a fully responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- See hover states for all interactive elements such as buttons, links, and social icons.
- Navigate a layout that closely matches the original Clipboard landing page design.
- Interact with a clean and accessible UI built using semantic HTML.

## My process
- Structured the page using **semantic HTML5** elements such as `main`, `section`, `article`, `nav`, and `footer`.
- Applied a **mobile-first workflow**, designing for small screens first and scaling up with media queries.
- Built layouts using **Flexbox** for alignment and component structure, and **CSS Grid** for more complex sections.
- Used **CSS custom properties (variables)** to manage colors and maintain a consistent design system.
- Followed the **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology for class naming to improve readability and scalability.
- Implemented responsive background images for different screen sizes.
- Added hover states and transitions to buttons, links, and SVG icons to enhance user experience.
